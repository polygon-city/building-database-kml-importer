# TODO

- Work out how to structure files for import (KML? CSV? GeoJSON?)
- How is the location for each file defined and retreived?
- What about OSM linkage?
- What happens when an update needs to be applied in the future?
- How should buildings that are bulk-imported be defined in the database?
- Find a dataset to use as an an example
- What user should be attributed to the upload? None?
- How should the bulk importer be run? CLI? Web?
- If CLI, is it run on the server or locally?
- How will the files be uploaded? One-by-one or all in one go?
